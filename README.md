## TODO:
```
DONE 1. Fill trimmed_curve data
DONE 2. Change obj list to dict with ID as tag
DONE 3. Add parent/child relation to trimmed_curve & circle
DONE 4. Add line equations to geometry objects
DONE 5. Add B-splines
DONE 6. Move plotting to new file

DONE 7. Generate nodes on lines - within geom type class
DONE 8. generate nodes based on edge loops rather than geometry
9. Advancing front panel/node generation

10. mesh smoothing
11. quad dominant mesh
12. fully quad mesh
```

## Advancing Front Algorithm:
- front composed tri panel sides
- sides are active or inactive.
    - Active if a new tri can be added onto them
    - Inactive if not and are removed
- loop through front until no more active sides left
- each iteration an active side is selected and a tri panel is generated by:
    - connecting to another node
        - check for intersection of sides
        - check for nodes in radius from ideal isoseles triangle
            - rate nearby nodes based on closest to isoseles
    - generating new node

## STEP Datastructure:
```
ADVANCED_FACE
    PLANE
    FACE_OUTER_BOUND+FACE_BOUND
        EDGE_LOOP
            ORIENTED EDGE
                EDGE_CURVE
                    VERTEX POINT
                    <geometry object>

geometry object:
    LINE
    POLYLINE
    CIRCLE
    BSPLINE
