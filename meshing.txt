unstructured mesh generation

1. initial domain - b-splines?
	a surface bounded by spines
	a point cloud mesh is insufficient as non-bounding vertexes are present

2. discretization - point to surface projection
	series of points mapped onto surface
	points mapped on bounding splines first, area within filled after
	spacing between points defined by mesh resolution

3. triangulation
	CDT performed on domain (constrained delaunay triangulation)
	maintains edges and boundaries
	TRIPACK

4. quad-dominant mesh
	rank potential merges of adjacent triangles
	based on how close angles would be to 90deg
	triangles merged according to ranking until no possible merges

5. fully quad mesh
	split all quads into 4
	split all triangles into 3 quads using triangle centroid

6. smoothing
